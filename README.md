# H.A.L.O.S
<b>Home Arithmatic Laboratory Operating System</b>

H.A.L.O.S is a complete rewrite of MikeOS and its various other derivations. Like MikeOS, It is made in assembly and It works in real mode(16-bit mode) making it usable on Older PCs. Its features are nearly same as that of MikeOS but it also adds external libraries to the original code including Mouse Library, Memory Manipulator, etc... Its major difference is its user interface which is renewed to be better.
